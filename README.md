# Mobile web app for viewing live bus arrival times at NYC bus stations

For my Human-Computer Interaction course at Georgia Tech, I redesigned both the signage and the mobile web app for accessing bus arrival times from MTA bus stops.

I developed a web app, available at [this link](https://rdas1.github.io/bus-time/#/403483), that retrieves and displays bus arrival times for any given stop (specified as a URL parameter). I designed and put up signs at four stations in Upper Manhattan with QR codes that lead to this website, so that real users can view bus arrival times.

So far, they've been totaling about 40 scans per day. I'm planning to put up more signs at other stations across NYC so that more people can easily view bus arrival times.


# Why?

Only 1% of NYC's 15k bus stops have electronic signage indicating bus arrivals times. At all other stops, riders are directed to a software solution called MTA Bus Time via text-heavy, cluttered signs:

    <img src="images/mta_sign.JPG" alt="Current MTA Signage" height="400"/>
    <img src="images/mta_interface.PNG" alt="Current MTA web interface" height="400"/>
</p>
These signs provide 5 options for accessing bus arrival times. Rather than emphasize the systemâ€™s flexibility, this graphic design overwhelms potential users and makes what should be a simple task seem overly complicated. Moreover, the interfaces themselves are difficult and often unpleasant to use. The SMS interface, for example, requires memorizing and typing in an arbitrary 6-digit stopcode to an arbitrary 7-digit number; and the mobile web app, while functional, is visually dated and somewhat jargon-heavy.

I wanted to redesign both the mobile web interface and its access point in such a way that I could deploy a live prototype, and provide reliable arrival-time information to real users in my neighborhood (and beyond).
